This is iOS app companion for the project Sockly started by Alexey Agafonov. It's a smart wall plug controlled using bluetooth low energy. For the first time I've read about the project in [this article](http://geektimes.ru/users/agafonishe/topics/) (rus). I found it interesting and have joined Alexey as iOS developer. Unfortunately after some time it became really hard for me to find time to continue to work on the project because of main job and because of moving to another country. So we've agreed on my opt out from the project and making open source what I did so far. So Alexey or anybody else can reuse it if needed.

If you are interested in this project, you could contact [Alexey Agafonov](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/alexey-agafonov/8b/506/395) directly.
